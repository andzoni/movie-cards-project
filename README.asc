=== Movie Cards Library CRUD
* *What I've learned*:

  ** Use componentDidMount to perform an action after the component is inserted into the DOM;
  
  ** Use shouldComponentUpdate to assess whether or not a component update should happen at that time;
  
  ** Use componentDidUpdate to perform an action after the component is updated;
  
  ** Use componentWillUnmount to perform an action before the component is unmounted;
  
  ** Use props.children to access the children of a React component and interact with them;
  
  ** Use the BrowserRouter component correctly;
  
  ** Create navigation links in the application with the Link component;
  
  ** Create routes, mapping the URL path with the corresponding component, via Route ;
  
  ** Structure and organize the routes of your application with the Switch component;
  
Use the Redirect component to switch between routes.
